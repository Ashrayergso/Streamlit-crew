Shared Dependencies:

1. Libraries: The libraries pandas, streamlit, sqlalchemy, and sqlite3 are shared across all the files. They are used for data manipulation, building the web app interface, interacting with the database, and the database itself respectively.

2. Data Models: The data models defined in `models.py` (ShipSchedule, Position, Person, Contract, Qualification) are used across `load_data.py`, `scheduling.py`, and `app.py`. They are used to structure the data in the SQLite database and to interact with this data.

3. Database: The SQLite database `cruise-scheduler.db` is a shared resource used by `load_data.py` to populate data, `scheduling.py` to fetch data for the algorithm, and `app.py` to display data to the user.

4. Scheduling Algorithm: The scheduling algorithm implemented in `scheduling.py` is used in `app.py` to generate the list of available crew members based on user inputs.

5. Function Names: Functions for loading data, implementing the scheduling algorithm, and building the Streamlit app are shared across the respective files. These might include functions like `load_data()`, `schedule_crew()`, `build_app()`, etc.

6. User Inputs: User inputs taken in `app.py` (like role, ship, month) are used in `scheduling.py` to filter the data.

7. CRUD Functions: The Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functions defined in `app.py` are used to interact with the data in the SQLite database.

8. Streamlit Commands: Streamlit commands like `streamlit run app/app.py` are shared as they are used to run the application.
